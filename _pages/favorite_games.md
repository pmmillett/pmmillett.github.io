## The Legend of Zelda

Few franchises have had as lasting an impact on gaming as *The Legend of Zelda*. Since its debut in 1986, Nintendo's legendary series has set the standard for action-adventure games. Whether exploring the vast world of *Breath of the Wild*, solving the iconic puzzles of *Ocarina of Time*, or venturing through the dungeons of the original NES classic, Zelda games consistently deliver a sense of wonder and discovery that few other series can match.

**Highlights:**
- *The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time* (1998)
- *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild* (2017)
- *The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past* (1991)

## Super Mario Bros

Mario is gaming. Since 1985, Nintendo's mustachioed plumber has been the face of the industry, starring in some of the most creative and joyful platformers ever made. From the side-scrolling precision of the original NES titles to the open-world sandbox of *Super Mario Odyssey*, the series continually reinvents itself while never losing that signature charm and playability that made it a household name.

**Highlights:**
- *Super Mario Bros. 3* (1988)
- *Super Mario World* (1990)
- *Super Mario Odyssey* (2017)

## Mass Effect

BioWare's *Mass Effect* trilogy is one of the greatest achievements in narrative gaming. The series puts you in the boots of Commander Shepard, tasked with saving the galaxy from an ancient threat. What sets it apart is the depth of its characters, the weight of its choices, and the way decisions carry across all three games. Few RPGs have managed to make you genuinely care about a cast of fictional alien crewmates quite like Mass Effect does.

**Highlights:**
- *Mass Effect 2* (2010) — widely regarded as one of the best games ever made
- *Mass Effect* (2007) — the game that started it all
- *Mass Effect 3* (2012) — an emotional conclusion to an epic saga

## Metroid

Nintendo's *Metroid* franchise is the gold standard of atmospheric, exploration-driven gaming. Playing as the intergalactic bounty hunter Samus Aran, players navigate alien worlds filled with secrets, power-ups, and increasingly dangerous enemies. The series pioneered the "Metroidvania" genre and has consistently delivered some of the most immersive and isolating gaming experiences in history, rewarding curiosity and careful exploration above all else.

**Highlights:**
- *Super Metroid* (1994)
- *Metroid Prime* (2002)
- *Metroid Dread* (2021)
